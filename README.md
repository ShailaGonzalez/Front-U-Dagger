## 🚀 Project Development
This project was developed using Agile methodologies, with the following key functionalities:

- **Reusable Components**: Built with React's component-based architecture, making the application modular and scalable.

- **State Management**: React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` were used to manage component state.

- **Functional Programming**: Implemented ES6 methods such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for data processing and rendering.

- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS was used to create dynamic, scoped component styles without global conflicts.
